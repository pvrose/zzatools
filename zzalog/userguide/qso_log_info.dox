\section description_log_info Description

This pane allows the use to monitor the status of the log.

<IMG SRC="../images/qso_log_info_1.png">

The top line, enclosed in red below, indicates the status of the log. The circle indicates the status
of the log-book in local memory, and is accompanied by the equivalent text:

- Background colour - "No Data": there is no data.
- Changing from background to green - "Loading": loading data.
- Green - "Unmodified" : data has not been modified, or has been written back.
- Red - "Modified": data has been modified.
- Changing from red to green - "Storing": writing data.

The check-box, labeled "Save/QSO" when checked indicates that the log will be written back
after the completion of every QSO, or at other times when a record has been changed. Clicking
this check-box off will disable writing back of the log. At certain states of the application, 
the application will suspend writing back to reduce the number of unnecessary updates. When 
this happens, the check-box wll be unchecked. 

The button, "Save", when clicked will write back the log.
