/** \page adding Adding QSOs

Sometimes it is not possible to use computer logging. For case like this, ZZALOG provides a number of ways
to manually add QSO records. 

\section add_manual Adding QSOs manually

When ZZALOG starts it is in view mode. Click either "Cancel" to go to inactive mode or "Activate" to go to active mode.

The image below shows the inactive mode. Click "Add QSO" to go to manual entry mode.

In manual entry mode, the entry form is prepopulated with data from the selected QSO record. This makes it easier to
enter a sequence of QSOs.

Data may now be entered into the form as required. When complete the user can then save the record with one of the 
save buttons:

- "Save & New" - Save the current record and start a new record.
- "Save & Exit" - Save the current record and quit adding records.
- "Save & Edit" - Save the current, but continue editing it.

\section add_file Adding data from a file

It is possible to import data from another file. To do this select the menu option "Import->File" on the menu in
the Main Window. This will open a file selection dialog, and the records in the selected file will be
copied into the current logbook.

Note that there are two other file-related commands in this menu drop-down list:
- "File (Update QSOs)" - this option merges data between the other file and the current logbook and will query any
discreancy found.
- "File (QRZ.com)" - this option merges data received from QRZ.com and manipulates the data specifically for QRZ.com use.

\section add_clip Adding data from the clipboard

It is possible to select one or more ADIF records from a text editor and import into the current logbook.
Simply copy the records from the text editor using its copy procedure.Then in the logbook view in the Main Window
click the book and enter CTRL and V from the keyboard. Alternately, there is a menu item "Import->Clipboard".
