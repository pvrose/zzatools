/** \page qso_clocks Station Clock

This pane provides the station clock. It displays the time either in UTC (otherwise known
as GMT or Zulu) and in local time as defined by the operating system.

<IMG SRC="../images/qso_clocks_1.png">

How local time is named is dependent on the operating system. On the left is Windows 11 and 
on the right Debian Bookworm.
