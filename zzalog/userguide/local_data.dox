/** \page local_data Logbook data format

The logbook is kept as a text file, basically in ADIF 3 .adi format (see <A HREF="https://www.adif.org">ADIF specification</A>). Although ADIF specifically
only allows the use of ASCII printable characters (codes 32 to 254 inclusive) and, with restrictions, codes 10 (LF) and 13 (CR), 
ZZALOG will store non-ASCII characters as 
UTF-8. The count of characters in the ADIF specification is implemented as a byte count. So, for example, the name J&uuml;rgen witll be stored as

<CODE>
&lt;NAME:7&gt;J&uuml;rgen
</CODE>

When data is exported, it may contain non-ASCII characters. When this is the case an error is presented to the user. Most use cases are
unlikely to contain such data. 

The user may edit the text file with care and understanding of the ADIF specification.
ZZALOG may not be tolerant to errors intoduced by manual edits.
