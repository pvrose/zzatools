/** \page stn_dialog Setting this station details

This dialog allows the user to set various parameters about the current station. It has three tabs: #

a single identifier.

The station location, or QTH, should be identified by one or two words. A new location can be typed into

of callsigns current used in the log is presented. If the user selects a callsign then the following
fields: Country, DXCC, CQ Zone and Continent are entered automatically.
